# MusicMatch

Music Match is an app with a familiar an intuitive user interface with the goal of connecting music lovers who have similar tastes. The app includes a swipe feature on a playlist preview that a user can decide to then "like" or "dislike". If a user matches with another, each users respective spotify links are shared.

During this project I worked a lot with 
 - Figma to design my app
 - Firebase to store user information and make a functional login
 - React Native and React JS to code the app and it's functionality 
 - CSS to design the app 
 
 A presentation of my project can be found here: https://nolanpharris.weebly.com/music-match.html on my personal site. 
 The video demo of my app can be found here: https://youtu.be/-cByx07cSZw
